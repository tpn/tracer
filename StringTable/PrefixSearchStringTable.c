Routine Description:

    Searches a string table to see if any strings "prefix match" the given
    search string.  That is, whether any string in the table "starts with
    or is equal to" the search string.

Arguments:

    Rtl - Supplies a pointer to an RTL instance.

    StringTable - Supplies a pointer to a STRING_TABLE struct.

    String - Supplies a pointer to a STRING struct that contains the string to
        search for.

    Match - Optionally supplies a pointer to a variable that contains the
        address of a STRING_MATCH structure.  This will be populated with
        additional details about the match if a non-NULL pointer is supplied.

Return Value:

    Index of the prefix match if one was found, NO_MATCH_FOUND if not.

    // Unconditionally do the following five operations before checking any of
    // the results and determining how the search should proceed:
    //
    //  1. Load the search string into an Xmm register, and broadcast the first
    //     character of the string across a second Xmm register.
    //
    //  2. Load the string table's first character array into an Xmm register.
    //
    //  3. Broadcast the search string's length into a Ymm register.
    //
    //  3. Load the string table's slot lengths array into a Ymm register.
    //
    //  4. Compare the first character from step 1 to the string table's first
    //     character array set up in step 2.  The result of this comparison
    //     will produce an XMM register with each byte set to either 0xff if
    //     the first character was found, or 0x0 if it wasn't.  We then sign-
    //     extend this XMM register of 8-bit values into a YMM register of
    //     16-bit values, such that it can be subsequently compared to the YMM
    //     register generated in the next step.
    //
    //  5. Compare the search string's length from step 3 to the string table's
    //     slot length array set up in step 3.  This allows us to identify the
    //     slots that have strings that are of lesser or equal length to our
    //     search string.  As we're doing a prefix search, we can ignore any
    //     slots longer than our incoming search string.
    //
    // We do all five of these operations up front regardless of whether or not
    // they're strictly necessary.  That is, if the first character isn't in
    // the first character array, we don't need to load array lengths -- and
    // vice versa.  However, we assume the benefits afforded by giving the CPU
    // a bunch of independent things to do unconditionally up-front outweigh
    // the cost of putting in branches and conditionally loading things if
    // necessary.
    //

    //
    // Load the first 16-bytes of the search string into an XMM register.
